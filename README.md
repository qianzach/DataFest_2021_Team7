# Team 7 DataFest
Team 7, a group of undergraduate UCLA mathematics students, constructed a machine learning pipeline with the primary goal to identify significant demographic factors that could predict an individualâ€™s potential to misuse a non-prescription substance in the United States, as well as assess the efficacy of these factors, as seen in our abstract.

Completed during UCLA/ASA's 2021 Datafest.
